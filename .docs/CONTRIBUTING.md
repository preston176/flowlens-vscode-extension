# Contributing to FlowLens

Thanks for your interest in contributing! FlowLens is currently in early development â€” this doc explains how to help, what we accept, and how to get in touch.

## What we're looking for

- Design feedback on the landing page and UI mockups
- Bug reports and reproduction steps for any prototype code
- Ideas for UX flows, privacy, and sync options
- Help building the VS Code extension (when alpha begins)

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
3. Make your changes with clear, focused commits.
4. Open a pull request describing the change and why it helps.

If your PR changes behavior or adds a feature, include tests where possible and a short demo/gif showing the change.

## Issues

- Please file issues with a clear title, steps to reproduce (if applicable), and expected vs actual behavior.
- Tag issues `design`, `bug`, `proposal`, or `question` to help triage.

## Communication

For now, email contributions and major design feedback to: hello@flowlens.example (placeholder). As we mature, we'll add community channels and a contributors guide.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. This project follows a standard open-source Code of Conduct. By contributing, you agree to abide by it.
