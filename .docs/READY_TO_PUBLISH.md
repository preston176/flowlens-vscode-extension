3. Choose your publisher ID (e.g., `preston176` or `flowlens-team`)
4. Copy the ID

### 3. Update package.json

## 💡 Tips

1. **Icon is required** - Publishing will fail without it
2. **Test locally first** - Always run `vsce package` before publishing
3. **Keep PAT secure** - Never commit it to Git
4. **Marketing** - Share on social media after publishing
5. **Updates** - Use semantic versioning for updates
