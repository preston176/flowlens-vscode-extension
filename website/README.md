# FlowLens Website

This folder contains a small Vite + Preact + Tailwind site used as the project's landing page. It's designed to be deployed to Vercel as a static site.

Local commands:

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run dev   # local development
npm run build # production build to website/dist
npm run preview # preview the production build
```

Deploy to Vercel: push the repo and set the Vercel project to use the `website/` directory as the root.
